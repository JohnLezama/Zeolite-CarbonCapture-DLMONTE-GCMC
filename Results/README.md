The PROTECTED.csv files contain the raw simulated data of each zeolite configuration before being fitted to the Langmuir Isotherm model. The Template.csv file shows how the data is formatted.

The Visualization.md file contains 4 tables that hold all the raw simulated values, the QO and KL Langmuir Constants for CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms, and the langmuir fitted values for every zeolite configuration.
