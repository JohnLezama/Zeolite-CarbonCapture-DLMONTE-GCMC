# Zeolite-CarbonCapture-DLMONTE-GCMC
Java programs that take Si-O framework .xyz zeolite files, generates zeolite configurations with Si/Al ratios from 1.0 to 5.0 (0.5 increments), insert Na-cations, and automate DL_MONTE GCMC CO₂/N₂ adsorption simulations by updating CONTROL, FIELD, and CONFIG files and storing results.
